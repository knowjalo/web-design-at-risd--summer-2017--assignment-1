         <br><img src="img/Salvador-Dali.jpg" alt=" Salvador Dali" width="675">
         <blockquote>
            Dal&iacute; was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. Dal&iacute;â€™s expansive artistic r&eacute;pertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.
